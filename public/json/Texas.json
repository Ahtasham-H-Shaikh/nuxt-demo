Stabilized mortgage rates at around 6.60% make it even better. So, whether you are looking for a condo in Houston or a single-family home in Dallas, you can easily afford your dream Texas home. If you’re a seller, you can still make profits if you sell before prices decline any further. With the increased rate of home sales drop, you must be ready to offer concessions to buyers."

The number of homes for sale in Texas constantly grows to fulfill the demand of people moving here. It increased by 14% year over year in January 2025. About 142,352 homes for sale are available in Texas. Presently, the Texas market is balanced with 6 months of supply. Fewer months indicate a seller’s market and more months indicate a buyer’s market.<br><br> What does it mean for home buyers and sellers?<br> If you’re a buyer, you have an advantage with the increased number of homes for sale. The increasing inventory will potentially meet the demand and stabilize the house prices in Texas. Also, lower taxes attract more buyers. If you’re a seller, you must act fast and sell your home before more supply hits the Texas real estate market. Rising inventory could lower demand and lead to fewer offers from buyers. To attract buyers, focus on staging and marketing your home."
