        "description": "Florida housing prices show a 1.7% YoY growth as of December 2024. The constant growth in home prices indicates the strength of the housing market. Currently, the median home price in Florida is $410,800. The number of homes sold increased by 7.9% YoY.  You can also check the market competitiveness through median days on the market. Homes in Florida now spend 70 days on the market before going under a contract. All these metrics collectively indicate changes in the Florida housing market’s pace and affordability. What does it mean for home buyers and sellers? If you’re a buyer, you get more negotiation power due to extended median days on the market. Stabilized mortgage rates at around 6.50% make it even better. So, whether you are looking for a condo in Miami or a single-family home in Tampa, you can easily afford your dream Florida home. If you’re a seller, you can still make profits if you sell before prices decline any further. With increased Florida home sales drop, you must be ready to offer concessions to buyers."

        "description": "The percentage of homes selling above the list price is a key indicator of housing demand. When more homes sell for more than the list price, it shows strong buyer competition and high demand. A decline suggests more supply. Tracking this trend helps you gauge market competitiveness. Almost, 9.9% of homes in Florida sold above the list price in December 2024. Price drops increased slightly from last year with 21.7% of homes with price drops. The 96.4% sale-to-list price suggests fewer bidding wars and more price flexibility for buyers",

Florida's index stays 20% lower than major coastal states' average."
